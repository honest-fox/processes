# Quality Assurance FTW :zap:
Quality assurance and testing are probably two of the most important things we can do to deliver great work. This document is a living guideline of how we can deliver exceptional work every time.

## Principles
The name of the game with quality assurance is communication and teamwork. Clear communication, our developers and designers can articulate not only the desired outcome of a change, but also any opportunity costs along the way. Teamwork is at the heart of everything we do, working together will achieve the most well executed design and development for our clients.

## When to start and finish the QA Process
QA can begin at any point after development is kicked off. Ideally developers have enough time to structure a couple of key components and kick the tires of the design. The ideal number of QA iterations should be between 2 - 3 rounds and there should always be a clear end goal in sight. If things feel like they are spiralling beyond this number of rounds, it's probably a good time for a pow-wow with the wider team to get on the same page.

### QA Steps

1. Don't panic :smiley:
